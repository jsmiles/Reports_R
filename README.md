# Reports_R
How to create reports in R easily

# Summary
This repo showcases a simple way to automate the automation of regular reports in R. I utilise R, RStudio and various tools from 
the Tidyverse. Reporting is important but also time consuming. The extent to which you decide to automate a report is conditional
upon the frequency with which the report needs to be created, the complexity of the analysis, the development time available and
many other factors.
